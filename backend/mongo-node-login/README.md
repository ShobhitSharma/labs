Login using Node
================

####A basic login & account management system built in Node.js with the following features :

* New User Account Creation
* Secure Password Reset via Email
* Ability to Update / Delete Account
* Session Tracking for Logged-In Users
* Local Cookie Storage for Returning Users
* Blowfish-based Scheme Password Encryption

####Installation & Setup
This assumes you already have node.js & npm installed.
```
npm install -d
node app
```
For testing purposes, I've provided a [database dump of all accounts here.](http://node-login.braitsch.io/print)  
Please note this list and the entire database automatically resets every 24 hours.

Questions and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
